          <h2> Hear the why many have chosen Subarus</h2>
          <blockquote><small>I decided to go with a subaru because finding a clean evo 8/9 is hard.
          - " I love my subaru because its it's all wheel drive and make turbo noises"!
          <br>  - Peter
          <hr>
          <br> " Why I drive a subie: I drive a subie because it's fun to just drive one. Why I love my subie:
           I love my subie because I don’t have to worry about the 4 seasons we have in MN". <br>
           - Adam
           <hr>
           <br> "I chose my WRX cause it was low mileage and a good deal.
           I love my car cause it has enough power to pass up dumb drivers but comfortable enough for daily driving.
           Also, MN winters are not forgiving so it was the best option for sporty, awd, and affordable. Lol"<br>
           - Blong
           <hr>
           <br> "I chose a subie because I was young and stupid.
          What I love about my subie is that it’s like having a love/hate relationship. Sometimes you just wanna love
          it and sometimes you just want to hate it."<br>
          - Joey
          <hr>
          <br> "I chose Subaru because I grew up with it. Our very first subary was a 93' Impreza Wagon and from there my family kept working on subarus until I got my very own. They are great for the winter.
          I love my subie because it pulls when I need it to pull, especially when someone isn’t trying to let you in onto the highway.
          Its red too and that’s one of my favorite colors."<br>
          -Eveli
          <hr>
          <br>"
          I chose Subaru because they are Awd  and it feels safer on the turns. In snowy weather it offers you more security.
          I love them because they are so much fun to drive & I like how they are made".<br>
          -Rony
